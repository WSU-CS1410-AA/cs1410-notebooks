    "## Objects on the stack vs objects on the heap\n",
    "In week 6 under memory management, we talked about having two kinds of objects: those defined in the stack and those defined in the heap. Here are few example objects defined in the stack:\n",

    "BetterCounter bc(11);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "```C++\n",

    "d2.showDate();\n",
    "bc.increment();\n",
    "cout << bc.current();\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Objects defined in the heap are created dynamically using the `new` operator. These objects are, in fact, pointers. Here are some example objects defined in the heap:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c++\n",
    "DateClass *d4 = new DateClass;\n",
    "Counter *c2 = new Counter;\n",
    "Date *d5 = new Date;\n",
    "Date *d6 = new Date(2, 17, 2019);\n",
    "BetterCounter *bc2 = new BetterCounter(11);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Because heap objects are pointers, they require the use of **arrow operators** `->` to access their members:\n",
    "\n",
    "```C++\n",
    "d4->setDate(10, 12, 2018);\n",
    "d4->showDate();\n",

We use the keyword `static` to indicate that there is only one copy of the data member and that copy is shared by all objects of the class. In other words, **static members** operate at the class level and not at the object level.\n",

    "\n",
    "Looking at `SomeClass`, we see that it has one \"regular\" (called instance) data member named `someData` and another static member named `objectCount`. This `objectCount` does not belong to a particular object of this class. Instead, it belongs to the class itself, because it counts how many objects of this class have been instantiated. \n",

    "Classes in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) do not exist in isolation; they relate to one another. OOP focus on four main kinds of class relationships.\n",
    "* **Association** which is the most generic relationship between two classes A and B. For example, a student (class A) is taught by multiple instructors (class B).\n",
    "* **Aggregation** which captures the relationship between a child class and a parent class such that the child class can still exist outside or without the parent class. For example, a quiz (parent class) has many questions (child class). While the quiz is a container for questions, the questions can still exist and be useful outside the quiz.\n",
    "* **Composition** which captures the whole-part relationship such that the part cannot exist without the whole. For example, a room (the part) cannot exist without the house (the whole). Another example is a choice in a multiple-choice question. This choice depends on the question and cannot exist outside of it.\n",
    "* **Generalization**  where a class is said to be a special case of another, or look like another. Here we use the terms of **superclass** and **subclass** (or **base** and **derived**) with the subclass (or derived) being a special case of the superclass (or base). For example, a bank account can the thought of as a superclass for the more specialized checking and savings accounts. This relationship is the basis for **inheritance**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inheritance** is the cornerstone of OOP. It allows a class `A` to inherit the **public** and **protected** data and function members of another class `B`. **Private members and constructors cannot be inherited.**\n",

    "For example, having the calss:\n",

    "```c++\n",
    "class A {\n",

The `public` before the `A` indicates the kind of inheritance: in this case, **public inheritance**, which is the kind of inheritance that we should always use unless we have a valid reason not to. In this kind of inheritance, all the public members of the base class (`A`) will become public members in the derived `B` class. Similarly, all the protected members of the base `A` class will be made protected members of the derived `B` class. \n",
