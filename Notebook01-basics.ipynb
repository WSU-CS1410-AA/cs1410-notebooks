    "A *program* is a recipe for solving a problem or producing an outcome. It contains a list of detailed instructions describing precisely what a computer does to achieve that desired solution or outcome. The art and science of writing computer programs is called *programming*. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because computers are machines made of electrical circuitry where only the binary choices of *on* and *off* ( 1 and 0) are recognizable (or have meaning), the programs, that computers are able to run, need to be in this binary format as well. A program written in such a format is said to be in *machine code*, and it can be run (or executed) directly by the computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fact that computers only understand machine code, however, presents a problem for *programmers* (the human beings writing programs) who find it extremely difficult and time-consuming to work at that binary level. To bridge this understanding gap, *programming languages* were created. They allow programmers to write programs in a format close to their natural language (mostly English) and provide tools such as *compilers* and *interpreters* to convert their high-level programs into the machine code that the computer understands and is able to run.\n",

    "## Programming languages\n",
    "Many programming languages exist today and new ones are invented all the time. Some of these languages are low-level. Assembly is a low-level language with a linear one-to-one mapping between its instructions and their machine code counterparts. Low-level programming has the property of producing the fastest programs, but this gain in performance comes at the cost of its programming being difficult, time-consuming, and prone to errors. High-level languages such as C, C++, Java, C\\# Ruby, Python, JavaScript, and Scala, as the above figure shows, are easier to program but not as fast. Fortunately, programming using high-level languages is fast enough for most of what we need computers for. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using a high-level programming language has many advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "* It hides the details of computer hardware that programmers do not need to know to create programs.; thus separating hardware (the physical machine with all of its parts and wirings) from software (the programs that run on it.)\n",
    "* It allows programmers to focus more on solving problems rather than formatting programs in machine code.\n",
    "* It makes programming a lot easier to learn.\n",
    "* It makes programs a lot easier to read and understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming languages are classified, based on how often their programs are translated to machine code, into three camps:  compiled, interpreted, and both. A compiled language provides a special program called the *compiler* (thus the name *compiled*) to translate its programs into executable machine code. This translation happens only when the program is first written or when it changes. The generated machine code is used after that to run the program. Examples of compiled programming languages are C, C++, and Go. \n",
    "\n",
    "An interpreted language such as Python, Ruby, and JavaScript uses a program called the *interpreter* to run its programs. The interpreter translates the program to machine code every time it runs. The translation overhead makes interpreted programs slower than compiled ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yet some languages such as Java and C\\# are both compiled and interpreted. Their programs are first compiled to an intermediate binary form (bytecode for Java and intermediate language IL for C\\#). This compilation step happens only when the program is first written or when it changes. After that, the compiled intermediate binary form is interpreted every time these programs run.\n"

    "As a programmer, you need to have a sense of what a computer can and cannot do. The figure above depicts a simplified model of what a computer is from a programmer's perspective. It consists of four major components: processor, memory, input, and output. All the interactions between these components are initiated by the processor based on the program being executed. To execute a program, the computer does the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* It loads the program from the file it is saved under into the code section of the memory.\n",
    "* It loads the program to the processor for execution.\n",
    "* It executes the program instructions one at a time in the order specified by the program.\n",
    "* When the program needs to load data from file or get an input via the keyboard, it instructs the relevant parts of the computer to read (or load) data from the input device into the data memory section; It later loads the newly read data into the processor for processing.\n",
    "* Similarly, when the program needs to write some output to a device such as a screen, a printer or even a file on the hard drive, the processor stores that information in memory first and instructs the relevant output device to pick the data from there. \n",
    "\n",
    "The figure above also gives a hint to what a program is: an ordered list of fully-detailed and precise instructions loaded into the memory and executed by the processor to produce the desired output based on the given input. The instructions that make up a program are called *statements* and are of the following kinds:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Input:** Reads data from a keyboard, a file on the hard drive, or a URL on the web.\n",
    "* **Output:** Displays data on a screen, prints it, or writes it to a file.\n",
    "* **Arithmetics:** Add, subtract, multiply, divide, and compare.\n",
    "* **Conditional execution:** Executes an instruction or a set of instructions only when a certain condition is met.\n",
    "* **Repetitive execution:** Repeats executing an instruction or a set of instructions until a certain condition is met.\n",
    "* **Jumps:** Causes execution to jump from one part of the program to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, all computers do is perform mathematical and logical arithmetics, move things to/from the processor from/to the memory, jump from one program section to another, do certain things conditionally, and do other things repeatedly. \n",
    "\n",
    "It’s amazing how all the complex and powerful computer applications, that we currently use or can think of, can be stripped down to these six kinds of instructions/statements. This fact is not lost on programming languages; in their own ways, all programming languages support these basic kinds of instructions. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to understand here that there is no magic to computers or programming. There is only the human ingenuity, cleverness, and extremely creative engineering that solves the most complex problems using the above instruction kinds. In other words, a computer does not solve a problem, a programmer does by studying the problem, devising a solution, and coding that solution into a program that the computer can execute. \n",
    "\n",
    "The result of this realization is that the computer does exactly what you ask of it: no more and no less. It is as clever, as complex, or as simple as your program is. This is not to belittle what computers do but to stress the fact that anything a computer does is the result of an idea or a set of ideas thought of and reasoned thoroughly by a human and group of humans who took the time and effort to express these ideas in the programming form that computers understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having said that, it is truly amazing that an abstract idea expressed in a program can be brought to life or turned into reality by a computer. Perhaps that is the magic of computers: the idea-realizing machines."
