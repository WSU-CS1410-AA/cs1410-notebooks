    "\n",
    "From the very beginning, C++ was meant to be a better C: \n",
    "* to fix the known issues and vulnerabilities of C, \n",
    "* to solve the issues of structured programming seen in large-scale C programs, and \n",
    "* to support the, then-new, object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigm. \n",
    "\n",
    "Being an object-oriented programming (OOP) language meant:\n",
    "* The ability to create classes that represent new data types that go beyond the built-in types.\n",
    "* The ability to instantiate or create objects from these classes\n",
    "* The ability of one class to inherit from another class \n",
    "* The ability to take advantage of polymorphism.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the perspective of OOP, the real world is made up of entities such as automobiles, buildings, devices, shapes, cars, and so on. Each entity has **attributes**. For example, a car has the attributes: year, make, model, and color among other things. Each entity **behaves** or **acts** in some way as well. A car, for example, can move forward or backward, turn left or right, brake, turn on or off. \n",
    "\n",
    "In C++, we use **classes** to name and describe real-world entities, their attributes, and their behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "We call defining both attributes and behaviors under the same class **encapsulation**, which is a core principle of OOP. In C++, attributes are modeled with variables; they are called data members. On the other hand, behaviors are modeled with functions; they are called member functions. And the good news is that we already know how to define variables and functions. By defining classes, we get a better way of organizing code. A program becomes a collection of classes that build on top of and interact with one another. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, OOP supports **information hiding**, which allows us to make certain class members (data and/or function members) **private** and others **public**. There is also the ability to make classes inherit some or all of their attributes and behaviors from other classes. This, as we shall see, is useful in capturing the similarities between multiple entities, minimizing code repetition, and improving code reuse, all of which are important software-engineering goals.\n",
